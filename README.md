# CYH-Code-Mental-Health-Tracker

Mental Health is a serious and ongoing issue in todayâ€™s world. COVID - 19 has only escalated matters and this major issue has
been overlooked by society for decades. We have to create ways to make people more comfortable dealing with their mental
health and we need people and devices that can help them when they need it most. We designed an app that can help the user 
track their mental health and see their progress in the form of a journal and a rating of their day. This can help them 
identify triggers and common days which their mental health is best and worst. Our app will help not just help students 
recognize these triggers, but various age groups.

This tracker can help kids and adults:
- Track their mental health
- Look back at their previous journaling to reflect upon their past feelings and improve their mental health
- Journal their daily notes quickly and efficiently
- View their mental progress and identify triggers

To create this app we coded in Python used 3 external libraries. These include:
- CSV module to create a database
- Kivy graphics library to create easy to use user-interfaces
- Datetime module to keep track of past data, and archive entries

Notes when using app:
- After creating account close app and reopen, then login to the same account created.
